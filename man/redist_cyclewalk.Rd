\usage{
redist_cyclewalk(
  map,
  nsims,
  warmup = 0,
  thin = 1L,
  init_plan = NULL,
  counties = NULL,
  compactness = 1,
  constraints = list(),
  edge_weights = NULL,
  init_name = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  silent = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{A \link{redist_map} object.}

\item{nsims}{The number of samples to draw, not including warmup.}

\item{warmup}{The number of warmup samples to discard.}

\item{thin}{Save every \code{thin}-th sample. Defaults to no thinning (1).}

\item{init_plan}{The initial state of the map. If not provided, will default to
the reference map of the \code{map} object, or if none exists, will sample
a random initial state using \link{redist_smc}. You can also request
a random initial state by setting \code{init_plan="sample"}.}

\item{counties}{A vector containing county (or other administrative or
geographic unit) labels for each unit, which may be integers ranging from 1
to the number of counties, or a factor or character vector. If provided,
the algorithm will generate maps that tend to follow county lines.}

\item{compactness}{Controls the compactness of the generated districts, with
higher values preferring more compact districts. Must be nonnegative.}

\item{constraints}{A \link{redist_constr} object or list of constraints.}

\item{edge_weights}{Optional list of edge weights for the graph. Each element
should be a list with two fields: \code{edge} (a length-2 numeric vector of
vertex indices) and \code{weight} (a positive number). Edges not specified
default to weight 1.0. Higher weights make edges less likely to be cut or
linked in proposals (cost interpretation). Example:
\code{list(list(edge = c(1, 2), weight = 2.0))}.}

\item{init_name}{A name for the initial plan, or \code{FALSE} to not include
the initial plan in the output. Defaults to the column name of the
existing plan, or \verb{<init>} if the initial plan is sampled.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print out intermediate information while sampling.}

\item{silent}{Whether to suppress all diagnostic information.}
}
\value{
A \link{redist_plans} object containing the simulated plans.
}
\description{
\code{redist_cyclewalk} uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on
the CycleWalk method to generate redistricting plans. The algorithm maintains
a spanning forest representation of districts and proposes changes by finding
cycles between adjacent districts.
}
\details{
This function draws samples from a specific target measure, controlled by the
\code{map}, \code{compactness}, and \code{constraints} parameters.

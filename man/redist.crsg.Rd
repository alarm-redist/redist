\usage{
redist.crsg(
  adj,
  total_pop,
  shp,
  ndists,
  pop_tol,
  verbose = TRUE,
  maxiter = 5000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{List of length N, where N is the number of precincts.
Each list element is an integer vector indicating which precincts that precinct
is adjacent to.  It is assumed that precinct numbers start at 0.}

\item{total_pop}{numeric vector of length N, where N is the number of precincts.
Each element lists the population total of the corresponding precinct, and is
used to enforce pop_tol constraints.}

\item{shp}{An sf dataframe to compute area and centroids with.}

\item{ndists}{integer, the number of districts we want to partition the
precincts into.}

\item{pop_tol}{numeric, indicating how close district population targets have
to be to the target population before algorithm converges.  pop_tol=0.05 for
example means that all districts must be between 0.95 and 1.05 times the size
of target.pop in population size.}

\item{verbose}{boolean, indicating whether the time to run the algorithm is
printed.}

\item{maxiter}{integer, indicating maximum number of iterations to attempt
before convergence to population constraint fails.  If it fails once, it will
use a different set of start values and try again.  If it fails again,
redist.rsg() returns an object of all NAs, indicating that use of more
iterations may be advised. Default is 5000.}
}
\value{
list, containing three objects containing the completed redistricting
plan.
\itemize{
\item \code{plan}:  A vector of length N, indicating the
district membership of each precinct.
\item \code{district_list}  A list of length Ndistrict.  Each list contains a
vector of the precincts in the respective district.
\item \code{district_pop}  A vector of length Ndistrict, containing the
population totals of the respective districts.
}
}
\description{
\code{redist.crsg} generates redistricting plans using a random seed a grow
algorithm.  This is the compact districting algorithm described in Chen and
Rodden (2013).

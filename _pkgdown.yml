  title: An R package for legislative redistricting
  description: >
    This R package enables researchers to sample redistricting plans from a
    pre-specified target distribution using Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov
    Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The package supports various constraints in
    the redistricting process, such as geographic compactness and population
    parity requirements. Tools for analysis, including computation of various
    summary statistics and plotting functionality, are also included.
